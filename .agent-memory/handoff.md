## Operating Constraints

- Codex acts as Orchestrator only.
- Delegate implementation to Sub-Agents whenever tooling supports it.
- Keep Sub-Agent write scopes separate for parallel work.
- No Cloudflare deployment workflow applies to this repository.
- Do not write secrets, DB credentials, tokens, passwords, raw bearer tokens, session secrets, or personal Prolific data into memory files.
- Keep config.php local and ignored.
- Preserve root routing through / and absolute frontend paths.
